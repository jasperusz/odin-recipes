<p>Good men must eat good pasta.</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>400g (14 oz) spaghetti</li>
    <li>150g (5 oz) guanciale or pancetta, diced (guanciale is traditional for its rich flavor)</li>
    <li>4 large egg yolks</li>
    <li>1-2 whole large eggs (for extra creaminess)</li>
    <li>100g (3.5 oz) Pecorino Romano cheese, finely grated (or Parmesan as a substitute)</li>
    <li>1 tsp freshly ground black pepper, plus more for serving</li>
    <li>Salt for pasta water (about 1 tbsp)</li>
    <li>Optional: 1 clove garlic, whole (for flavoring the pan, then removed)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Preparation</h2>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Prepare the Pasta:</strong><em>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add spaghetti and cook according to package instructions until al dente (usually 8-10 minutes). Reserve 1 cup of pasta water before draining.</em></li>
    <li><strong>Cook the Guanciale:</strong><em>While pasta cooks, heat a large skillet over medium heat. Add diced guanciale (no oil needed—it renders its own fat). Cook until crispy and golden, about 5-7 minutes. If using, add a whole garlic clove for flavor and remove it once browned. Remove from heat if pasta isn't ready yet to avoid overcooking.</em></li>
    <li><strong>Make the Sauce:</strong><em>In a bowl, whisk together egg yolks, whole egg(s), grated cheese, and black pepper until smooth. This creates the base for the creamy sauce.</em></li>
    <li><strong>Combine Everything:</strong><em>Add drained spaghetti to the skillet with guanciale over low heat. Pour in the egg mixture and toss quickly to coat the pasta. Add reserved pasta water a little at a time (start with 1/2 cup) to create a silky sauce—stir vigorously to emulsify without scrambling the eggs. The heat from the pasta and pan should cook the eggs gently. Season with more pepper if desired.</em></li>
    <li><strong>Serve immediately</strong><em> with extra grated cheese and black pepper on top. For authenticity, avoid cream, onions, or peas—these are common but non-traditional additions. Pair with a crisp white wine for a complete meal.</em></li>
</ol>
